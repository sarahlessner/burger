### Overview

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM

* Eat All the Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Nom. Ate it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
